# GitHub Access Token

tfaction requires GitHub Access Token.

Due to the restriction of the repository's GITHUB_TOKEN, tfaction requires other GitHub Access Token too.

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow

> When you use the repository's GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN will not create a new workflow run.

We recommend using GitHub App's Token instead of Personal Access Token.

There are some GitHub Actions to create GitHub App's Access Token.
